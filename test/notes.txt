This C language work of Ted's is a first attempt to write a C-based shared object type library.  The on-line tutorial reference at Swathmore University is a starting point, and includes example calls to the compiler gcc such that shared objects can be created.  Here is the pair of calls to gcc which Ted invoked to obtain a working shared object file named libtestlib0.so:


    $ gcc -o testlib.o -c functions-string.c

    $ gcc -shared -o testlib.so testlib.o -lm


Here is a call to gcc on the source file c/test/main.c, to compile this stub program against libtestlib0.so:


    $ gcc main.c -I/usr/local/include/testlib0 -ltestlib0


This line assumes that the given library header file, in this case named functions-string.h, has been copied to the location /usr/local/include/testlib0/.  Also assumed is that the shared object named libtestlib0.so has been copied to /usr/local/lib.  In summary then after compiling the shared object file, in order to make use of this new test library the following copying steps must be done:


    $ pwd
    /home/fulano/projects/c/test-library/

    $ sudo cp functions-string.h /usr/local/include/testlib0

    $ sudo cp libtestlib0.so /usr/local/lib


As of today 2017 February 13 the stub program main.c calls a function in the shared object, the only function so far there defined, a function which takes two strings and concatenates them, and returns a modified pointer to the beginning of the combined strings.  Strangely the pointer upon return to the main.c main routine no longer points to the combined string.  This is a separate issue of memory management, different from the work of getting a shared object file to function, but it is also in part related:  to make full use of shared object libraries we must understand how write C code which correctly returns modified values and modified pointers to memory.  Ted looking into whether this incorrect pointer dereferencing is a scoping issue, a shared memory issue, or some other issue . . .   - TMH
